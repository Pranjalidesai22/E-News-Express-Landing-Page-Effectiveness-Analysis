E-News Express: Landing Page Effectiveness Analysis

Project Overview
E-News Express is an online news platform aiming to expand its user base by attracting new subscribers. This project involves a statistical analysis of a new landing page's effectiveness in improving user engagement and conversion rates. The results are derived from a controlled experiment conducted to compare the old and new landing pages.

Introduction
This project answers critical business questions about user behavior and the impact of the new landing page on:
a. Time spent on the page
b. Conversion rates
c. Influence of preferred language on user engagement

Business Problem
The objective is to determine whether the new landing page drives better user engagement and conversions compared to the old page, using a variety of statistical tests.

Methodology
Steps Taken:
a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed dataset with 100 entries and 6 columns to understand patterns.
Assessed categorical and numerical data distributions.
b. Hypothesis Testing:
Conducted statistical tests (two-sample t-test, two-proportion z-test, chi-square test, and one-way ANOVA) to validate findings.

Statistical Tests Conducted:
Two-sample t-test: Time spent comparison between old and new landing pages.
Two-proportion z-test: Conversion rate comparison.
Chi-square test for independence: Relationship between language preference and conversion.
One-way ANOVA: Time spent based on preferred language.

Findings
a.Time Spent:
Users spend significantly more time on the new landing page (p < 0.05).
b. Conversion Rate:
Conversion rate for the new page is significantly higher (p < 0.05).
c. Language Preference:
Conversion status is independent of preferred language (p > 0.05).
Td. ime by Language:
Time spent on the new page is consistent across languages (p > 0.05).

Conclusion and Recommendations
Implement New Landing Page: Results show higher engagement and conversion rates.
Language Expansion: Adding more languages could further increase user acquisition.
Focus on Engagement: Leverage insights to optimize user experience further.
